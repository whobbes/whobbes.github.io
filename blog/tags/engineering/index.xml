&lt;p&gt;Book by Robert Pirsig, written in 1968. It became a best-seller very quickly and seen as a book that carries culture of his time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It contains three intertwined plots narrated by the first person. It is about a motorcycle ride of father and son through America, Mental health of the narrator and An essay on values and quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really got hooked by the start of the book, his unique style and questioning of fundamental values. The presentation of the Quality thesis is the pinnacle of the piece. The last third of the book is more obscure and go on about Greek philosophy where it feels like the whole debate is made on play on words and definition rather than actual advancement of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;85%&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
