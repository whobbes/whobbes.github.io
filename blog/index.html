<p>Unfortunately, our brains have not yet adapted to our modern times, and probably never will. Our culture and livelihood are changing faster than the seasons and we need to make sense of our societies in order to understand where to go from here. Computers can crunch numbers ever so fast, and it is now down to the individual to know what to ask. This is where statistics come in handy, even if they are often portrayed as complex.</p>
<p>D. Spiegelhalter, statistician at Cambridge University, propose in the Art of Statistics a new approach firmly grounded in concrete examples and down-to-earth. Where there are numbers, events and probabilities statistics offer us invaluable tools to make sense of the situations and avoid fooling the easiest person to fool, ourselves.</p>
<p>I learned stats a few times, and do not use them often enough to keep it fresh in my mind. This time around, even if I did not learn new tools, I thought the approach was great, and the stories interesting enough to make it a great read.</p>

<p>The first step in order to change is to realize the need for change. Thinking about carbon footprint for a little while,  I started making minute changes last year largely based on randomly gathered ideas I had about what is carbon efficient or not.</p>
<p>To progress further, I needed data. A good friend told me about this book  <em>How bad are bananas</em>  that comprises a hundred different items and their footprints. It turns out only some of my ideas were correct, and that my correctness was not correlated with my confidence level; I got surprised.</p>
<p>This is a must-read to whom want to dive a little bit deeper in the world of carbon footprint, and will provide easy yet powerful steps to reduce one energy consumption.</p>
<p>As for me, I realize that my random small efforts help, but a more thought-about plan would probably bring better results. Below are a couple of noteworthy information that will be extended in the future.</p>

<p>I went through this book as other studied it as part of a regular meeting. Its tone is very similar to the pragmatic programmer and written in 2008 by an Extreme programming guru nicknamed Uncle Bob. While it contains lots of insights and tips and tricks about programming in general its tone is also quite dogmatic at times and even arbitrary when the author does not make a clear effort at explaining rational behind rules. The reader is left to blindly trust the guru or go and try it himself. In the end, this is probably the main point of the book, here is how I code after quite a big mileage. Here are the things to look for, smells, and some approaches I use when figuring out the best way to code. Now go coding and see how this pans out for you. To sum up, it is a refreshing book that gives good ideas about what to focus on when programming to hopefully progress towards writing better code faster; a must read for serious coders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know which of us has written this page.&rdquo; By those words the author finishes the simply named Borges and I parable  that illustrate so well what Labyrinths  is all about. Borges writes short, efficient texts with very powerful ideas and reflections. This meandering book first published in 1962, made of short stories, essays and parables explores the complexity of the mind, reality and the universe through the central theme of infinity.</p>

<p>Book by the author of Keras, F. Chollet about what is deep learning how to apply it to common tasks. Very well written and easy to follow, it focuses on practical teaching rather than theory. I read it two years ago and as the field is moving very fast content is a bit dated, best to wait for the second edition in Q2 2020.</p>

<p>This orange volume with a name too long to be of any use beside marketing, actually contains some valuable insights. Its main subject is about parenting but many ideas expressed are applicable in much wider context; a bit heavy in anecdotal stories.</p>

<p>Yuval Noah Harari was famous for  Sapiens about the past, then Homo Deus about the future and now focus on the present.</p>
<p>Comparing this book to the two previous one is easy. 21 lessons feel rushed in the writing and less well researched in the ideas. What we have here is a quick summary of previous books in a quick-read format. That being said, it makes the author's main ideas easy to remember.</p>
<p>Special mention for the effort of the author on being impartial where possible and focusing on presenting important and difficult questions to ask and not making speculations on potential solutions.</p>

<p>This book by Donald A. Norman is part of the classics of design with a first edition in 1988 and a updated version in 2013.</p>
<p>Many strong concepts such as affordances and signifiers are defined here and the point of view is very much oriented towards function over form,  which can be a debatable stance. The emphasis of the book is that simple interactions are difficult to create and one way to to so is to embrace user-centered design.</p>
<p>The book closes on an discussion of the inclusion of emotions in the process; Dan explored it further in a <a href="google.com">TED talk</a>. Every day objects will change slowly and happiness feeling while using the item is important. If one is happy then brain goes towards creative mode, if one is anxious and concentrated brain only focus on current task, exploration vs. exploitation, ideation vs. execution.</p>

<p>Book by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas about programming written in 1999 and part of the classics of CS. It contains some good ideas, some obvious and some outdated. Overall very good, no ground-breaking but good reminder to focus on value and quality.</p>
